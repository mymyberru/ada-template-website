            <h3>Agency Briefing</h3>
            <h1>Welcome, Detective!</h1>
            <p>We need your expertise. Are you ready to join our team for an exciting investigation into a mystery that has spanned decades? Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover the secrets behind movie endings and explore why some stories always conclude on a positive note – a "happy ending".</p>
            
            <p>Movies have the power to transport us to imaginary worlds, but what about their endings? Why are some endings so predictable, and why do certain ones seem to fulfill a universal need? This is exactly what you will uncover in this mission.</p>
            
            <p>Your investigation will cover several key aspects:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cinematic genres:</strong> How do genre conventions influence movie endings?</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution over time:</strong> How have endings evolved throughout the decades?</li>
                <li><strong>The creators behind these endings:</strong> Who are the directors and screenwriters who choose to make love, friendship, or justice triumph?</li>
                <li><strong>The driving force:</strong> Does commercial success play a role in the prevalence of "happy endings"?</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural differences:</strong> What are the differences in movie endings around the world?</li>
                <li><strong>Franchises and audience impact:</strong> How are "happy endings" used in major franchises and long films?</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Detective, the world of cinema awaits you. We count on you to solve this mystery and reveal the hidden secrets of a cinematic tradition that still influences how we tell stories today.</p>
